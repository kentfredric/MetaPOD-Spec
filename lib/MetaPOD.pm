=head1 What is MetaPOD

=head2 1. Documentation About Documentation

MetaPOD is a system intended to express the relationships between different documents, and express the importance and context of other things within the documents, and express how the documents as a whole fit together

=head2 2. Documentation about Meta

MetaPOD also is a system by which one can express relationships about code, code which has documentation, but how the documentation is related to other documentation requires you to normally understand the meta-level information within the code works, so, this system aims to make the "meta level" more visible from the surface, so the meta-level information can be more easily used to

=head1 What can MetaPOD do for me

At present, there is not much built on top of the MetaPOD C<API>, so it is marginally limited.

And at present, there is not much on C<CPAN> with MetaPOD annotations, so any such functionality is presently limited by that.

However, for a taste of what we might see with widespread use of MetaPOD, here is what we can easily determine from the present C<API>, with the existing annotations in within MetaPOD itself: http://kentfredric.github.io/MetaPOD/media/self_structure.png

=head1 People who are writing MetaPOD

Eventually, the goal is to have the MetaPOD itself able to be generated via tools during development, so that the meta-layer information is cemented into the POD itself, before, or during release.

In that vein, I hope to make a C<Dist::Zilla> plug-in that does this for you.

In the mean time, the documents you want to be reading are

=over 4

=item * L<< C<MetaPOD::Spec>|MetaPOD::Spec >> - The general specification for all forms of MetaPOD

=item * L<< C<MetaPOD::JSON>|MetaPOD::JSON >> - Information specific to the C<JSON> based implementation of MetaPOD
