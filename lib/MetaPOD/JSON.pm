=head1 NAME

MetaPOD::JSON - The JSON Formatted MetaPOD Spec

=head1 VERSION

version v0.5.0

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This is mostly a documentation stub, documenting the C<JSON> Formatted version of MetaPOD

The Actual Implementation is stored in L<< C<::Format::JSON>|MetaPOD::Format::JSON >>

=begin MetaPOD::JSON v1.1.0

{ "namespace":"MetaPOD::JSON" }


=end MetaPOD::JSON

=for Pod::Coverage implementation_class

=head1 Using MetaPOD::JSON in your documentation

    =begin MetaPOD::JSON

    {  "valid_json_data":"goes_here" }

    =end

or

    =for MetaPOD::JSON { valid_json_data }

    =cut

You can also declare a version for which semantics to imbue into the declaration.

    =begin MetaPOD::JSON v1.0.0

as Per L<< C<::Spec>|MetaPOD::Spec >>, the "v" is required, and the version semantics are always dotted decimal.

Note: As Per L<< C<::Spec>|MetaPOD::Spec >>, the version is B<NOT> a minimum version requirement, but a declaration of the
versions semantics the containing declaration is encoded in. Given implementations B<MAY> support multiple versions, or they
B<MAY NOT> support multiple versions.

It is B<ENCOURAGED> that wherever possible to support the B<WIDEST> variety of versions.

=head1 SPEC VERSION v1.2.1

This version of the spec is mostly identical to L</SPEC VERSION v1.2.0>, and it is bi-directionally compatible with it.

However, v1.2.0 made the omission of the definition of C<sub.entry>, and this spec revision simply corrects that defect.

=head2 C<sub.entry>

In C<v1.2.1>, a C<sub.entry> is a simple C<HASH>, with only 1 supported key.

=head3 C<name>

    { "name":"SomeName" }

This field should describe the name of the C<sub> symbol it pertains to.

At the time of this spec, there is no way to declare multiple facets of a single C<sub> description in separate declarations.

The following C<POD> code

    =begin MetaPOD::JSON v1.2.1

    { "subs": [ { "name":"Foo" } ] }

    =end MetaPOD::JSON

    =begin MetaPOD::JSON v1.2.1

    { "subs": [ { "name":"Foo" } ] }

    =end MetaPOD::JSON

is equivalent to

    =begin MetaPOD::JSON v1.2.1

    { "subs": [ { "name":"Foo" }, { "name":"Foo" } ] }

    =end MetaPOD::JSON

Which simply communicates that although it is only possible for there to be one physical Perl C<sub> C<Foo>, some internal
dispatch magic differences means they're effectively two separate C<sub>'s from the context of calling code.

( For instance, when signature support is added, they may have different signatures and different signatures have different
behaviours, and its clearer to simply document each kind of behaviour as a separate method than to try codify the complex logic
of how the internal signature conditions work )

=head1 SPEC VERSION v1.2.0

This version of the spec is mostly identical to L</SPEC VERSION v1.1.0>, and it B<MUST> support all features
of that version, with the following additions.

=head2 C<subs>

C<subs>, are a low-level critical component of any Perl Module. A C<sub> may manifest in various forms, some being exported,
others being inherited or composed. Some C<subs> are C<methods>, other subs are C<functions>. Some C<subs> are dynamically
generated from C<attribute> declarations, or are delegates for C<attribute> methods.

The distinction between all these types will be improved upon in a future release of C<MetaPOD::Spec>

So, with that said, any C<sub> declaration in this version of C<MetaPOD::JSON> simply indicates that a C<coderef> of some
description is accessible to calling code at the name C<< B<namespace>::B<sub> >>.

This include, but is not limited to, things like C<BUILD>, C<BUILDARGS> and C<import>.

It is important to understand that this data is intended to articulate I<ONLY> C<subs> that are declared I<IN> and I<BY> the
given C<namespace>.

Thus, documenting C<subs> that are inherited, composed, or imported into the namespace is considered an I<ERROR>, as observing
that data is intended to require observing the inheritance model.

I<Method Modifiers> such as C<override>, C<around>, etc, for the purposes of this feature, should be considered the same as
simply having re-declared the C<sub> by the same name.

=head3 C<subs> as a single token

Supporting this version of the spec B<MUST> implement support for this notation:

    { "subs" : "BUILD" }

This should be interpreted the same as

    { "subs" : [ "BUILD" ] }

Which is the same as

    { "subs" : [ { "name" : "BUILD" } ] }

See also L<< Multiple Declaration|/Mulitple Declaration >>

=head3 C<subs> as a single hash

Supporting this version of the spec B<MUST> implement support for this notation:

    { "subs" : { "name":"BUILD" } }

This should be interpreted the same as

    { "subs" : [ { "name" : "BUILD" } ] }

See also L<< Multiple Declaration|/Multiple Declaration >>

=head3 C<subs> as a list of tokens

Supporting this version of the spec B<MUST> implement support for this notation:

    { "subs": [ "BUILD", "import", "add_foo" ] }

This logic should be interpreted as a declaration of a list of ambiguously defined C<sub>s, and identical to

    { "subs": [
        { "name": "BUILD" },
        { "name": "import" },
        { "name": "add_foo" }
    ] }

As such, duplicate tokens B<SHOULD> be supported. ( This proviso is to add scope for multiple dispatch with a list of identically
named methods with different signatures and behaviours )

=head3 C<subs> as a list of C<HASH> entries.

Supporting this version of the spec B<MUST> implement support for this notation:

    { "subs": [ {entry}, {entry}, {entry} ] }

Each entry should be interpreted as an individual C<sub> declaration, as specified by C<sub.entry>. Duplicates permitted.

=head3 C<subs> as a list of mixed tokens and C<HASH> entries.

Supporting this version of the spec B<MUST> implement support for this notation:

    { "subs": [ "BUILD", { "name":"import" } ] }

As with the I<list of tokens>, non C<HASH> entries should be inflated to C<HASH> entries by transforming
as

    "entry" => { "name": "entry" }

=head3 Multiple Declaration

Implementations B<SHOULD> support multiple declarations for this field similar to how C<interface> works.

So:

    { "subs": "foo" }
    { "subs": [ "foo" ] }

Should be equivalent.

    { "subs": "foo" } +  { "subs": "foo" }
    { "subs": [ "foo", "foo" ] }

And

    { "subs": [ "foo"  ] } +  { "subs": [ "bar" ] }
    { "subs": [ "foo", "bar" ] }

=head2 C<sub.entry>

This field was not formally designed in the release of C<v1.2.0> spec, and although the definition of the field seems obvious
enough when looking at the C<sub> specification, it is not formally described.

This should be resolved in the v1.2.1 spec.

Though consuming C<MetaPOD> documentation should be usable with either.

=head1 SPEC VERSION v1.1.0

This version of the spec is mostly identical to L</SPEC VERSION v1.0.0>, and it B<MUST> support all features
of that version, with the following additions.

=head2 interface

There are many ways for Perl Name spaces to behave, and this property indicates what style of interfaces a given name space
supports.

SPEC VERSION v1.1.0 Supports 6 interface types:

=over 4

=item * C<class> - Indicating the given name space has a constructor of some kind, which returns a C<bless>'ed object.

For instance, if your synopsis looks like this:

    use Foo;
    my $instance = Foo->new();
    $instance->();

Then you should include C<class> in your L</interface> list.

=item * C<role> - Indicating the given C<namespace> is a "role" of some kind, and cannot be instantiated, only composed into
other C<class>es.

For instance, if your synopsis looks like this:

    package Foo;
    use Moo;
    with "YourNameSpace";

You should include C<role> in your L</interface> list.

=item * C<exporter> - Indicating the given C<namespace> C<exports> things into the caller

For instance, if your synopsis looks like this:

    use Foo qw( func );
    use Foo;
    bar(); # Exported by Foo

Then you should include C<exporter> in your L</interface> list.

This includes things like C<Moo> and C<Moose> which export functions like C<has> into the calling C<namespace>.

=item * C<functions> - Indicating a C<namespace> which has functions intended to be called via fully qualified names.

For instance, if your synopsis looks like this:

    use Foo;
    Foo::bar();

Then you should include C<functions> in your L</interface> list.

=item * C<single_class> - A Hybrid between C<functions> and C<class>, a C<namespace> which has methods, but no constructor, and
the C<namespace> itself behaves much like a singleton.

For instance, if your synopsis looks like this:

    use Foo;
    Foo->set_thing( 1 );

Then you should include C<singleclass> in your L</interface> list.

These usages are also candidates for C<singleclass> L</interface>es.

    Foo->copy( $a , $b ); # a and/or b is modified, but no object is returned
    my $result = Foo->bar(); # $result is not an object

However, this is not an example of the C<single_class> interface:

    use Foo;
    my $instance = Foo->writer( $bar );
    $instance->method();

Because here, C<writer> doesn't modify the state of C<Foo>, and C<writer> could be seen as simply an alternative constructor.

=item * C<type_library> - A Type Library of some kind.

For instance, if your class uses C<Moose::Util::TypeConstraints> to create a named type of some kind, and that type is accessible
via

    has Foo => (
        isa => 'TypeName'
    );

Then you want to include C<type_library> in your L</interface> list.

Note: Some type libraries, notably L<< C<MooseX::Types>|MooseX::Types >> perform type creation in I<addition> to exporting, and
for such libraries, you should include both C<type_library> and C<exporter>

=back

Name spaces that meet above definitions B<SHOULD> document such interfaces as such:

    { "interface": [ "class", "exporter" ]}

C<interface> can be in one of 2 forms.

    { "interface" : $string }
    { "interface" : [ $string, $string, $string ] }

Both will perform logically appending either the string, or the list of elements, to an internal list which is deduplicated.

So that

    { "interface" : [ $a ]}
    { "interface" : [ $b ]}

And

    { "interface" : $a }
    { "interface" : $b }

Have the same effect, the result being the same as if you had specified

    { "interface" : [ $a, $b ] }

=head1 SPEC VERSION v1.0.0

=head2 Data collection

Spec version 1.0.0 is such that multiple declarations should be merged to form an aggregate

e.g.:

    =for MetaPOD::JSON v1.0.0 { "a":"b" }

    =for MetaPOD::JSON v1.0.0 { "c":"d" }

this should be the same  as if one had done

    =begin MetaPOD::JSON v1.0.0

    {
        "a" : "b"
        "c" : "d"
    }

    =end MetaPOD::JSON

With the observation that latter keys may clobber preceding keys.

=head2 Scope

Because of the Data Collection design, it is not supported to declare multiple name-spaces
within the same file at present.

This is mostly a practical consideration, as without this consideration, all declarations of class members would require
re-stating the class, and that would quickly become tiresome.

=head2 KEYS

=head3 C<namespace>

All C<MetaPOD::JSON> containing documents B<SHOULD> contain at least one C<namespace> declaration.

Example:

    { "namespace": "My::Library" }

=head3 C<inherits>

Any C<MetaPOD::JSON> containing document that is known to inherit from another class, B<SHOULD> document their inheritance as
such:

    { "inherits": [ "Moose::Object" ]}

C<inherits> can be in one of 2 forms.

    { "inherits" : $string }
    { "inherits" : [ $string, $string, $string ] }

Both will perform logically appending either the string, or the list of elements, to an internal list which is deduplicated.

So that

    { "inherits" : [ $a ]}
    { "inherits" : [ $b ]}

And

    { "inherits" : $a }
    { "inherits" : $b }

Have the same effect, the result being the same as if you had specified

    { "inherits" : [ $a, $b ] }

=head3 C<does>

Any C<MetaPOD::JSON> containing document that is known to "do" another role, B<SHOULD> document their inheritance as such:

    { "does": [ "Some::Role" ]}

C<does> can be in one of 2 forms.

    { "does" : $string }
    { "does" : [ $string, $string, $string ] }

Both will perform logically appending either the string, or the list of elements, to an internal list which is deduplicated.

So that

    { "does" : [ $a ]}
    { "does" : [ $b ]}

And

    { "does" : $a }
    { "does" : $b }

Have the same effect, the result being the same as if you had specified

    { "does" : [ $a, $b ] }
