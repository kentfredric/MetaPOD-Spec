NAME
    MetaPOD::Spec - The Specification of the MetaPOD format

VERSION
    version 0.4.1

Specifying MetaPOD
  FORMATS
    A FORMAT is a MetaPOD Subclass.

    Segments will be parsed looking for

        MetaPOD::([^\s]+)

    Where $1 is the name of the MetaPOD "FORMAT"

    e.g:

        =begin MetaPOD::JSON

        { JSON DATA }

        =end MetaPOD::JSON

    These may, or may not, correspond to real world parser names, but the
    actual code loaded may be determined by the parser, and this declaration
    is more an indication of a *specification*

    And it may be that a "MetaPOD::JSON" declaration loads
    MetaPOD::Format::JSON

  VERSIONS
    A VERSION as part of a Segment declaration must come after the format
    declaration, preceded only by white-space.

    A VERSION declaration must start with a "v"

    ALL VERSIONS will be assumed to be dotted-decimal, and parsed with the
    'v' included.

    These versions however do not necessarily have to map to a "CPAN"
    Version, and is instead supposed to be an indication of the
    *specification* version, a specification that may be provided by
    multiple "CPAN" packages/versions.

    What this means to the *specification* is at the whim of the format, and
    it is the formats job to respond to a version declaration.

    "FORMATS" may either

    *   reject a version as being "too new" and thus not supported by a back
        end

    *   change behaviour based on the value of this version

    *   reject a version as being "too old" to be supported by the back end

  Segment Declaration
    A MetaPOD specification can be added to a POD document via one of the
    following forms

   Block Segments
        =begin MetaPOD::FORMAT

        FORMATDATA

        =end MetaPOD::FORMAT

    And

        =begin MetaPOD::FORMAT VERSION

        FORMATDATA

        =end MetaPOD::FORMAT

   One Line Segments
        =for MetaPOD::FORMAT FORMATDATA

    and

        =for MetaPOD::FORMAT VERSION FORMATDATA

  Multiple Segment Declaration
    It is the design of this Spec to recommend that segment declarations
    Should be permissible to be declared multiple times, and it should use
    this information to gather data progressively, merging data as it goes.
